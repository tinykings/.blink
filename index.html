👀 Find this Fermented Salsa recipe in our app to scale the amounts, get step-by-step photo instructions, and find detailed nutrition info. Or find it below:
INGREDIENTS
~ For 2 servings ~
(¼ cup per serving)

2 large tomatoes, finely chopped
1 yellow bell pepper, finely chopped 
1 small red onion, finely chopped
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 jalapeño, de-seeded, finely chopped
1½ lime, juiced
¾ cup fresh cilantro, finely chopped
2 Tbsp water, as needed
1 Tbsp fine sea salt
½ tsp chili powder
½ tsp ground cumin

DIRECTIONS
1. Add all the ingredients to a large bowl.
2. Stir until the salsa starts to release some of its juices.
3. Transfer to a 1-litre jar. Pack down the veggies as well as possible*.
4. Use a fermenting weight to make sure all the veggies are submerged in the brine. If needed add a little bit of water to cover all the veggies**.
5. Close the lid and let ferment on the counter for 2 days. Make sure to open the lid once a day to "burp" the ferment and to check for bubbles***.
6. Taste test the salsa often, and if the fermenting is to your liking transfer the jar to the fridge****.
7. Serve as desired with your favourite nourish bowl, on tacos, or enjoy with some simple tortilla chips.

NOTES
* Use a clean, non-metallic jar to prevent reactions with the salt or acid.
** If you don’t have fermenting weights, you could use a large slice of bell pepper on top of the salsa to press the salsa down well and submerge it below the brine.
*** Throughout the fermentation process, check the salsa and make sure all the vegetables are still submerged under the brine. Things will mold if they go above the brine or if there is no liquid at the top.
**** If your space is very warm, fermentation may take as little as one day.

Need a lightweight powerhouse laptop that actually performs? I picked up the 2024 ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 in a pinch last summer for an emergency video editing job and spoiler alert: I still use it almost daily. With an AMD Ryzen 9 8945HS CPU, RTX 4070 GPU, 3K OLED display, and only 3.3 lbs in weight, it’s a beast for content creators and gamers alike.

In today’s review, I’ll walk you through my real-world experience after nearly a year of use - including what I love and what I wish ASUS would change. From thermal performance to battery life and even a very bright Slash lighting array, I’m not holding back.

<div id="summary-37" class="summary" style="display: none;">More than 160 people were killed in a Nigerian village last month in an attack on farming communities blamed on armed herders in the breadbasket region of the country. Tensions between farmers and herders have led to a major security threat in Nigeria. Survivors describe a gruesome scene where people were burned alive in their homes and women and children were attacked with machetes. NPR’s Emmanuel Akinwotu has more from the pediatric ward at Benue State University Teaching Hospital in Makurdi, Nigeria.</div>

"Without a warning, all of a sudden, a warplane hit the place, shaking it like an earthquake," he said.

Dozens were wounded, many critically, alongside at least 30 people killed, said Fares Awad, head of the Health Ministry's emergency and ambulance service in northern Gaza.</div>

<p class="published-date">2025-07-03 07:57:23</p>
<p class="feed-title">top scoring links : OpenAI</p>
<button class="toggle-summary-btn" data-target="summary-48">...</button>
<div id="summary-48" class="summary" style="display: none;">A team of Spanish researchers just published a follow-up to Apple's controversial "Illusion of Thinking" paper that claimed Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like Claude and ChatGPT can't actually reason - they're just "stochastic parrots." What Apple Found (June 2025):  AI models failed miserably at classic puzzles like Towers of Hanoi and River Crossing Performance collapsed when puzzles got complex Concluded AI has no real reasoning ability  What This New Study Found: Towers of Hanoi Results:  Apple was partially right - even with better prompting methods, AI still fails around 8+ disks BUT the failures weren't just due to output length limits (a common criticism) LRMs do have genuine reasoning limitations for complex sequential problems  River Crossing Results:  Apple's study was fundamentally flawed - they tested unsolvable puzzle configurations When researchers only tested actually solvable puzzles, LRMs solved instances with 100+ agents effortlessly What looked like catastrophic AI failure was actually just bad experimental design  The Real Takeaway: The truth is nuanced. LRMs aren't just pattern-matching parrots, but they're not human-level reasoners either. They're "stochastic, RL-tuned searchers in a discrete state space we barely understand." Some problems they handle brilliantly (River Crossing with proper setup), others consistently break them (complex Towers of Hanoi). The key insight: task difficulty doesn't scale linearly with problem size - some medium-sized problems are harder than massive ones. Why This Matters: This research shows we need better ways to evaluate AI reasoning rather than just throwing harder problems at models. The authors argue we need to "map the terrain" of what these systems can and can't do through careful experimentation. The AI reasoning debate is far from settled, but this study suggests the reality is more complex than either "AI is just autocomplete" or "AI can truly reason" camps claim.

<p class="published-date">2025-07-03 07:48:48</p>
<p class="feed-title">top scoring links : sysadmin</p>
<button class="toggle-summary-btn" data-target="summary-49">...</button>
<div id="summary-49" class="summary" style="display: none;">We run a small digital agency in Australia and recently experienced a 38-day outage with Microsoft Exchange Online, during which we were completely unable to send emails due to backend issues on Microsoft’s side. This caused major business disruptions and financial losses. (I’ve mentioned this in a previous post.) What’s most concerning is that Microsoft later reclassified the incident as a "CPE" (Customer Premises Equipment) issue, even though the root cause was clearly within their own cloud infrastructure, specifically their Exchange Online servers. They then closed the case and shifted responsibility to their reseller partner, despite the fact that Australia has strong consumer protection laws requiring service providers to take responsibility for major service failures. We’re now in the process of pursuing legal action under Australian Consumer Law, but I wanted to post here because this seems like a broader issue that could affect others too. Has anyone here encountered similar situations where Microsoft (or other cloud providers) reclassified infrastructure-related service failures as "CPE" to avoid SLA credits or compensation? I’d be interested to hear how others have handled it. Sorry got a bit of communication messed up. We are the MSP "We genuinely care about your experience and are committed to ensuring that this issue is resolved to your satisfaction. From your escalation, we understand that despite the mailbox being licensed under Microsoft 365 Business Standard (49 GB quota), it is currently restricted by legacy backend quotas (ProhibitSendQuota: 2 GB, ProhibitSendReceiveQuota: 2.3 GB), which has led to a persistent send/receive failure." This is what Microsoft's support stated If anyone feels like they can override the legacy backend quota as an MSP/CSP, please explain. Just so everyone is clear, this was not an on-prem migration to cloud, it has always been in the cloud.    submitted by    /u/rubixstudios   [link] [comments]</div>

Subscribe to our NTS Sub Club by July 18 to get your copy with free worldwide shipping https://www.nts-store.com/. This issue is a full-spectrum celebration of colour—featuring bold Madrid bathrooms, Neapolitan flair, Memphis madness, and so much more.

What was once an abandoned apartment in Naples is now a vibrant home and studio, reimagined by architect couple Giuseppe Punzo and Julie Nebout of La Fotosintesi. With a love of colour, craftsmanship, and contrast, the couple reimagined the historic space to reflect both the city's layered history and their own creative lives. Original features like patterned cement tiles and an original wall uncovered during the renovation were left exposed, its aged surface adding texture and contrast to the modern elements throughout the home. A compact kitchen and open-plan living area encourage gathering, while a mezzanine studio, tucked-away desk, and flexible guest setup maximise function. Outside, a sunny terrace with a repurposed tub offers sweeping views of Naples—from the sea to the volcanoes.

<div id="summary-57" class="summary" style="display: none;">Today the unthinkable happened. I had someone report an issue with their PC that required onsite attention. So sure, I'll come down and take a look. While checking out her PC she leaves for a second and returns with a card that hard my name on it. So I opened it and it was a thank you card with a $25 Timmies gift card! I couldn't believe it I was flabbergasted. I of course said thank you etc... she was just a fellow employee too, not even a VIP which made it more shocking.  Not posting this to brag or anything. Just thought it was crazy that no matter how much you think people don't appreciate you, someone does. Just putting this out there for my fellow admins. No matter how you feel there is at least one user out there who genuinely appreciates you!     submitted by    /u/weanis2   [link] [comments]</div>

<div id="summary-58" class="summary" style="display: none;">The Buccaneers Season 2 is now streaming on Apple TV+  https://www.apple.co/_Buccaneers

In the first season of The Buccaneers, a group of fun-loving young American girls exploded into the tightly corseted London of the 1870s … setting hearts racing and kicking off an Anglo-American culture clash. Now the Buccaneers are no longer the invaders — England is their home. In fact, they’re practically running the place. Nan is the Duchess of Tintagel, the most influential woman in the country. Conchita is Lady Brightlingsea, heroine to a wave of young American heiresses. And Jinny is on every front page, wanted for the kidnapping of her unborn child. All of the girls have been forced to grow up and now have to fight to be heard, as they wrestle with romance, lust, jealousy, births and deaths … themes consuming all women of any age, no matter what year it is. Last time we got a taste of England. This time we’re in for a veritable feast.

Written by series creator Katherine Jakeways, season two is directed by BAFTA Award winner William McGregor, DGA Award winner Rachel Leiterman, John Hardwick and Charlie Manton. Jakeways, BAFTA Award nominee Beth Willis and BAFTA Award winner Susanna White serve as executive producers. “The Buccaneers” is produced for Apple TV+ by The Forge Entertainment, a Banijay UK company.

Hey :) I’m Christian, and I began living on the road full-time in May 2018. This journey began in 2013 when I left the corporate world to build my career as an outdoor adventure & travel photographer. After 14 months of SUV living - I bought the van I now call home. Van life enables me to experience and document the beauty of our natural world, while also having my home and office nearby. My hope is that by sharing my own personal highs and lows along this (sometimes) wild journey, you might be inspired to hit the road or spend more time outdoors. Maybe one day I'll see you out on that open road 🚐

<div id="summary-74" class="summary" style="display: none;">Violent, twisted, and dark. Everyone learns to love The Mule — sooner or later. Foundation Season 3 premieres July 11 on Apple TV+ https://apple.co/_Foundation

Foundation has captivated audiences with its intricate world-building, stunning visuals, bold storytelling, and compelling performances. Season 3 continues the epic chronicle of a band of exiles on their monumental journey to save humanity and rebuild civilization amid the fall of the Galactic Empire. 

Set 152 years after the events of Season 2, the Foundation has become increasingly established far beyond its humble beginnings while the Cleonic Dynasty’s Empire has dwindled. As both of these galactic powers forge an uneasy alliance, a threat to the entire galaxy appears in the fearsome form of a warlord known as “The Mule” whose sights are set on ruling the universe by use of physical and military force, as well as mind control. It’s anyone’s guess who will win, who will lose, who will live, and who will die as Hari Seldon, Gaal Dornick, the Cleons, and Demerzel play a potentially deadly game of intergalactic chess.

<div id="summary-82" class="summary" style="display: none;">Simu Liu is an actor, superhero, and noodle obsessive—so obsessed, he joined the team at MìLà, the beloved dumpling and noodle brand. But today, he faces his spiciest nemesis yet: Chef Esther Choi.

After “training for weeks,” Simu takes on Esther’s three-course menu: a fiery remix of poutine, a DIY spicy KBBQ ssam, and an absolutely insane chili king crab noodle finale. Along the way, he builds his dream (co-ed) Marvel boy band, talks heroes vs. villains, bonds with Esther over growing up in immigrant families - and finds out if spice is his greatest foe… or his newest superpower.

<div id="summary-97" class="summary" style="display: none;">What’s really inside the Sun… and how do we know??

Turns out, like scientists learn what’s inside the Earth with waves from earthquakes, one way we learn what’s inside the Sun with… sound waves!

We can also look at the light coming from the sun 
Because when light from the Sun’s inner layers passes through outer ones, some wavelengths get absorbed by specific elements… which we can read like a bar code…

And the Sun is constantly blasting out tiny particles called neutrinos from the nuclear fusion in the Sun’s core… and by detecting them, we can get a direct peek at what’s happening in there… as of a little over 8 minutes ago!

<div id="summary-100" class="summary" style="display: none;">A multitrillion dollar tax cut and spending bill is heading back to the House after passing the Senate yesterday in a tie-breaking vote casted by Vice President Vance. One senator who was undecided until the last minute was Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski, who voted yes.

Republican leaders changed the bill to appeal to Murkowski and win her vote, including doubling a fund to help rural hospitals, issuing a reprieve for Alaskans from new Supplemental Nutrition Assistant Program work requirements, plus a tax break for whalers. Murkowski called the vote "agonizing."

House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries says the bill does more than just leave some Americans less advantaged.</div>

<div id="summary-102" class="summary" style="display: none;">When 98% of the company has no idea what you really do. We recently were given a "Self assesment" survey and one of the questions was essentially "Do you have any issues or concerns with your day to day". All I wanted to type was "It's nearly impossible for others to find value in my work when nobody understands it". I think this is something that is pretty common in IT. Many times when I worked in bigger companies though, my bosses would filter these issues. As long as they understood and were good with what I was doing, that's all that mattered because they could filter the BS and go to leadership with "He's doing great, give him a raise!" Now being a solo sysadmin, quite literally I am the only person here running all of our back end and I get lot's of little complaints. Stupid stuff like "Hey I have to enter MFA all the time on my browser, can we make this go away" from the CEO that is traveling all the time. Or contractors that are in bed with our VP that need basically "all access passes" to application and cloud management and I just have to give it because "we're on a time crunch just DO it". Security? What's that? Who cares - it gets in the way! I know its just me bitching. Just curious if any of you solo guys out there kind of run in to this issue and have found ways around the wall of "no understand". I love where I work and the people I work with just concerned leadership overlooks the cogs in the machine.    submitted by    /u/Paintrain8284   [link] [comments]</div>

The ultimate apex aliens have finally emerged, rapidly spreading their deadly tendrils across our planet. It will take all our heroes working together, using all their experience and expertise, to save our species. New relationships are formed, old relationship are challenged and even shattered, as our international cast of characters must become a team before it’s too late. 

The third season of Invasion stars returning cast members Golshifteh Farahani, Shioli Kutsuna, Shamier Anderson, India Brown, Shane Zaza, Enver Gjokaj, and introduces new series regular Erika Alexander.

Invasion is created by Kinberg and Weil, who also serve as executive producers alongside Audrey Chon, David Witz, Alik Sakharov, Dan Dietz, Katie O’Connell Marsh and Nick Nantell.
